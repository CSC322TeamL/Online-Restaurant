# Project description

This is CSC 32200 final project. Topic is online restaurant. 

### Backend:

Backend we use python language, and having Flask framework run on python's virtual environment.

All the python code is on the `[demoSever.py](http://demosever.py)` file.

Before running this file, your machine should have the `pymongo`, `bson`, `flask`, and `flask_restful` packages installed.

To run the back, just simply locate to the directory which `[demoSever.py](http://demosever.py)` is at in the terminal, and use `python demoSever.py` to have the server running.

### Frontend:

For the frontend we use Android apps, written in Java.

There are three apps:

`Code/SimpleRestaurant` is the Android project for users and delivery people.

under the `Code` directory there's a `app-debug.akp` can be download and install.

this apk is for the `SimpleRestaurant` projcet.

`cher` is the Android project for the chefs.

`Manager` is the Android project for Managers.

All three projects should be open on AndroidStudio.

### Database:

We use MongoDB as our database support.

We move our locate database to MongoDB Atlas so that we can work on the same dataset.

the link for the MongoDB Compass is

mongodb+srv://Luke:123@cluster0.hi0jb.mongodb.net/test?authSource=admin&replicaSet=atlas-dco2hl-shard-0&readPreference=primary&appname=MongoDB%20Compass&ssl=true

Also, `AllData` directory has the data backups.
